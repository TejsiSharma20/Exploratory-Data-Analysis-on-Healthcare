# Healthcare Data Analysis: EDA on Patient and Billing Information

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a healthcare dataset to uncover insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, admissions, and billing data. By analyzing the distribution of age, gender, blood type, and common medical conditions, this project highlights key trends that can improve healthcare operations.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information about healthcare patients, including personal details, medical conditions, hospital information, and billing data. It includes 55,502 records and 15 columns. Key columns in the dataset include:

- **Demographic Data**: Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type
- **Medical Information**: Medical Condition, Admission Type, Medication, Test Results
- **Hospital Data**: Doctor, Hospital, Insurance Provider
- **Billing Information**: Billing Amount

Note: The "Room Number" column is not relevant for this analysis as it contains no data.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Understand Patient Demographics**: Distribution of age, gender, and blood types among patients.
   
2. **Analyze Medical Conditions**: Common medical conditions treated across hospitals.
   
3. **Billing Insights**: Explore the relationship between billing amounts and admission types.
   
4. **Trends in Admissions**: Investigate trends in patient admissions over time (e.g., seasonal patterns).
   
5. **Medication and Test Results**: Analyze the correlation between medications and test results.
    
6. **Visualizing Correlations**: Generate a correlation heatmap for numerical data.

## Libraries Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

 ##  Analysis & Results
This project includes several key analyses and visualizations:

Demographic Distribution: Visualized using bar plots.
Medical Condition Analysis: Most common conditions identified.

Billing Insights: Relationship between billing amounts and admission types.

Seasonal Admission Trends: Time series analysis of admission trends.

Correlation Heatmap: Identifying correlations between numerical variables.

The results provide actionable insights that can improve healthcare decision-making and operational efficiency.
